# Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It was originally developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

Kubernetes enables users to run containerized workloads across multiple nodes, providing features such as load balancing, service discovery, storage orchestration, and automatic failover. It provides a unified API for managing containers, allowing users to deploy and manage containerized applications with ease, regardless of the underlying infrastructure.

Kubernetes supports various container runtimes, including Docker, CRI-O, and containerd, and can be run on a wide range of platforms, from on-premises data centers to public and private cloud environments.

With Kubernetes, users can achieve several benefits, including:

Scalability: Kubernetes enables users to scale their containerized applications up or down automatically based on demand, ensuring that the application can handle increased traffic and workload without downtime or performance issues.

Availability and resiliency: Kubernetes provides features such as automatic failover, self-healing, and rolling updates, ensuring that the application is always available and resilient to failures.

Portability: Kubernetes provides a unified API for managing containers, enabling users to deploy and manage containerized applications across multiple environments, from on-premises data centers to public and private cloud environments.

DevOps collaboration: Kubernetes enables collaboration between development and operations teams by providing a common platform for managing containers and applications, improving communication and efficiency.
